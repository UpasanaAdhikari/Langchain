      "Here are 5 interesting facts about Artificial Intelligence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **AI's Name Was Coined in 1956:** The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was first coined by computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. This landmark event is often considered the birth of AI as a field of study, bringing together researchers to discuss the possibility of machines simulating human intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **You Interact with AI Daily (Often Without Realizing It):** From the personalized recommendations on Netflix and Spotify, to the spam filters in your email, the voice assistants on your phone (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant), and even the navigation apps optimizing your route – AI is constantly working behind the scenes to make our digital lives more efficient and tailored.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Current AI is \"Narrow AI\":** Despite sci-fi portrayals, today's AI is primarily \"narrow AI\" or \"weak AI.\" This means it's designed to perform specific tasks extremely well (like playing chess, recognizing faces, or translating languages) but lacks general human-like intelligence, common sense, or the ability to apply learning across different domains. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which would possess human-level cognitive abilities, is still a theoretical concept and a distant goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **AI Can \"Hallucinate\":** Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative AI can sometimes produce outputs that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or completely fabricated, yet presented confidently. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"hallucination,\" and it highlights that these models don't \"understand\" information in the human sense, but rather predict the most probable sequence of words or data based on their training.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **AI Has Won Against Humans in Complex Games:** AI has repeatedly demonstrated its superior computational power and strategic capabilities by defeating human champions in highly complex games. Notable examples include IBM's Deep Blue beating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeating Go world champion Lee Sedol in 2016, and more recently, AIs excelling in games like StarCraft II and Dota 2, which require real-time strategy, incomplete information, and complex decision-making.\n"

      "\n",
      "*   **Definition:** A situation where individuals who are **able to work**, **willing to work**, and **actively seeking employment** cannot find a job.\n",
      "*   **Labor Force:** Consists of all employed and unemployed people.\n",
      "    *   **Employed:** People who work for pay (full-time or part-time) or work in their own business.\n",
      "    *   **Unemployed:** People who are not working but are available for work and have actively looked for work in the past four weeks.\n",
      "*   **Not in Labor Force:** Individuals not employed and not actively seeking work (e.g., retirees, students, stay-at-home parents, discouraged workers).\n",
      "*   **Unemployment Rate:** The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.\n",
      "    *   **Formula:** (Number of Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100\n",

      "### II. Key Concepts & Types of Unemployment\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Full Employment:**\n",
      "    *   Does *not* mean 0% unemployment.\n",
      "    *   Refers to the level of employment where only frictional and structural unemployment exist, with no cyclical unemployment.\n",
      "    *   Often associated with the \"Natural Rate of Unemployment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU):**\n",
      "    *   The unemployment rate that prevails when the economy is producing at its potential output.\n",
      "    *   Comprises frictional and structural unemployment.\n",
      "    *   It's the lowest sustainable unemployment rate without causing accelerating inflation.\n",

      "    *   **Definition:** Short-term unemployment that occurs when people are voluntarily between jobs, searching for their first job, or re-entering the workforce.\n",
      "    *   **Cause:** Imperfect information in the labor market, time needed for job searching and matching.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** A recent college graduate looking for their first professional job; someone quitting one job to find a better one.\n",
      "    *   **Nature:** Generally considered healthy and unavoidable in a dynamic economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **2. Structural Unemployment:**\n",
      "    *   **Definition:** Long-term unemployment caused by a mismatch between the skills workers possess and the skills demanded by employers, or a mismatch between the location of jobs and the location of workers.\n",
      "    *   **Causes:** Technological advancements (automation), shifts in industry (decline of manufacturing), globalization, lack of education/training, minimum wage laws (if set too high), labor union power.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Coal miners losing jobs due to a shift to renewable energy; factory workers replaced by robots.\n",
      "    *   **Nature:** Requires retraining, education, or relocation policies to address.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **3. Cyclical Unemployment:**\n",
      "    *   **Definition:** Unemployment that rises and falls with the business cycle. It occurs due to a general downturn in economic activity (recession or depression).\n",
      "    *   **Cause:** Insufficient aggregate demand in the economy, leading to reduced production and layoffs.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Workers laid off during a recession when consumer spending and business investment decline.\n",
      "    *   **Nature:** Most concerning type as it indicates an economy operating below its potential. Can be addressed by demand-side policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **4. Seasonal Unemployment:**\n",
      "    *   **Definition:** Unemployment that occurs due to predictable, recurring changes in demand for labor over the year.\n",
      "    *   **Cause:** Seasonal variations in industries like agriculture, tourism, construction, or retail.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Ski instructors unemployed in summer; construction workers during winter in cold climates.\n",

      "\n",
      "2.  **Economic Consequences:**\n",
      "    *   **Lost Output (GDP):** Unemployed resources mean the economy is producing below its potential. (Okun's Law: Higher unemployment means lower GDP growth).\n",
      "    *   **Reduced Tax Revenue:** Fewer people working means less income and consumption tax revenue for the government.\n",
      "    *   **Increased Government Spending:** Higher demand for unemployment benefits, welfare programs, and social services.\n",
      "    *   **Downward Pressure on Wages:** A surplus of labor can depress wages for those who are employed.\n",
      "    *   **Loss of Human Capital:** Society loses the productive potential of its workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Social Consequences:**\n",
      "    *   **Increased Poverty & Inequality:** Unemployment disproportionately affects vulnerable groups.\n",
      "    *   **Social Unrest & Crime:** High unemployment can lead to frustration, desperation, and social instability.\n",
      "    *   **Health Issues:** Higher rates of physical and mental health problems in communities with high unemployment.\n",

      "\n",
      "2.  **Supply-Side Policies (Target Structural & Frictional Unemployment):**\n",
      "    *   **Education & Training Programs:** Retraining programs for displaced workers, vocational training for new skills.\n",
      "    *   **Labor Market Information:** Improving job search services, online platforms, career counseling to reduce frictional unemployment.\n",
      "    *   **Subsidies:** To firms for hiring long-term unemployed or for training new employees.\n",
      "    *   **Infrastructure Investment:** Improving transportation and communication to facilitate labor mobility.\n",
      "    *   **Deregulation:** Reducing barriers to starting businesses or hiring workers (controversial).\n",
      "    *   **Reforming Unemployment Benefits:** Balancing the safety net with incentives to find work.\n",
